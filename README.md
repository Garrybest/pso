# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) 
### User Guide
This repository is a PSO solver using Java. 
It consists of `binary PSO` solver and `hybrid PSO with gaussian mutation` solver.
You can solve your own nonlinear programming problem by implementing the `OptModel` interface.
Also, you can use your own solver by extending the `AbstractPSO` class.
